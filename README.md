## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check that your Azure OpenAI credentials are correct in `.env`
- Ensure port 3001 is not already in use
- Verify Node.js version is 18+

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Confirm backend is running on port 3001
- Check `.env` in frontend has correct API URL
- Verify CORS is enabled in backend

### AI responses are slow
- This is normal - Azure OpenAI may take 5-10 seconds
- Consider reducing `max_tokens` in `openai.js` for faster responses
- Check your Azure OpenAI quota and rate limits
